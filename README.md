# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Tkinter allows two players to play in a 3x3 grid with turn-based moves. It features turn indicators, a score tracker, and a restart button for new matches. The game highlights the winning combination and announces results via a popup. With a clean UI and real-time updates, it's a fun and interactive way to enjoy game.


Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮❌⭕
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a two-player game built using Python's Tkinter GUI library. Players take turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. The game features turn indicators, a score tracker, and a restart button to start a new match without restarting the application.

✨ Features:
✅ Interactive UI: Players click on buttons to place their marks (X or O) in a 3x3 grid.
✅ Win Detection: The game checks for winning combinations and highlights the winner’s marks in green.
✅ Turn Indicator: The current player’s turn is displayed with blue for X and red for O.
✅ Score Tracking: Keeps track of wins for both players (X & O).
✅ Draw Handling: If all grid spaces are filled with no winner, the game announces a draw.
✅ Restart Option: Players can reset the board and play again without restarting the program.
✅ Error Handling: Prevents players from overwriting an already marked cell.

🛠 How It Works:
1️⃣ Players take turns clicking on an empty grid cell to mark it with X or O.
2️⃣ The game checks if the current player has won by forming a row, column, or diagonal.
3️⃣ If a player wins, their winning marks are highlighted in green, and a message box announces the winner.
4️⃣ If the grid is fully filled with no winner, a message box announces a draw.
5️⃣ The score is updated accordingly, and players can click the Restart Game button to start a new round.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
Tkinter (for GUI)
messagebox (for pop-up messages)
This project is a fun, simple, and interactive way to play Tic-Tac-Toe while practicing Python GUI development! 🎉
